# Ride Cancellation Analysis 

## Problem Statement

A ride-hailing platform experiences order failures when customers don't successfully get a car. This project analyzes failed orders to identify key failure patterns—including cancellations
(before/after driver assignment) and rejections—and investigates how these failures vary by time of day. By examining metrics like cancellation timing and estimated time of arrival (ETA),
this project aims to uncover operational insights that could improve match success rates and customer experience.
